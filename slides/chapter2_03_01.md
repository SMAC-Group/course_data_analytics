# Simple functions for vectors

---

Here are some examples:

```r
mean(grand_slam_win)
median(grand_slam_win)
sd(grand_slam_win)
sum(grand_slam_win)
length(grand_slam_win)
```

---

The functions `order` and `sort` are particularly useful!

```r
x = c(1,3,5,8,1)
sort(x)
sort(x, decreasing = FALSE)
sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)
order(x)
x[order(x)]
```

# Representing the distribution of a single variable

---

 
 Consider that we want to represent graphically the distribution of the literacy rate. We could consider representing the distribution of this variable using a boxplot. Other graphical tools and estimator of the density of this random variable could be a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE), Histogram or Violin plot. One can produce such plots with the following `R` commands:

- boxplot

- histogramm

- KDE
- Violin plot

- barplot 

- dotplot

- line chart

<exercise id="1" title="Installing R and RStudio">

## Installing `R`

This course will make use of the `R` programming language. The `R` language is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the [`R` Foundation for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). `R` is widely used by data scientists, data miners and statisticians for data analysis and developing statistical software.

### Installing `R` on macOS

To install `R` on macOS, download the `.pkg` installer on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `R` on Windows

To install `R` on Windows, download the `.exe` installer on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `R` in Ubuntu Linux

To install `R` on Ubuntu Linux, follow the procedure detailled [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).


## Installing `RStudio`

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. We will be using RStudio Desktop throughout the semester. Please install it from the [RStudio‚Äôs official webpage](https://www.rstudio.com/).


### Installing `RStudio` on macOS

To install `RStudio` on macOS, download the macOS `.dmg` installer on the [RStudio‚Äôs products page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `RStudio` on Windows

To install `RStudio` on Windows, download the Windows `.exe` installer the [RStudio‚Äôs products page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `RStudio` in Ubuntu Linux

To install `RStudio` on Ubuntu Linux, download the Ubuntu/Debian `.deb` installer the [RStudio‚Äôs products page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You can then install the `.deb` file.

### Installing `R` package `idar` 

We have developed an `R` package for this class which is called `idar` (Introduction to Data Analytics with `R` - `idar`) and that you can install by running the following code in your R console:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/SMAC-Group/idar", force = TRUE)
```

To test if the package is correctly installed you can simply run

```r
library(idar)
```

If you see no error then the package is correctly installed! Below is a gif illustrating the installation of the `idar` `R` package:

<exercise id="4" title="Analysis of the Diet dataset">


<slides source="chapter1_diet">
</slides>
</exercise>

<exercise id="5" title="Exercises on the Diet dataset">

Previously, we saw that Diet B was effective in reducing the weights of the participants. Is it also the case for Diet A?

### 1. How to get the data?

Complete the code below to get the data for Diet A:

<codeblock id="chap1_diet_1">

The variable `posw` allows to select the diet we are interested in.

</codeblock>

### 2. How to plot the data?

Complete the code below to plot the data for Diet A:

<codeblock id="chap1_diet_2">

You can use the function `boxplot_w_points`.

</codeblock>

### 3. Which test should we use?

Based on the graph you produced which test appears the most appropriate to test if Diet A leads to a significant weight loss:

<choice id="chap1_diet_1">
<opt text="t-test."> The t-test doesn't appear to be an ideal choice in this case given the outliers that can be observed in the graph...</opt>
<opt text="Wilcoxon test." correct = "true" > Given the outliers that can be observed this test appears to be a suitable choice. </opt>
<opt text="other tests should be used here."> While it is true that other methods could be used here, one of the two tests above seems reasonable here. </opt>
</choice>

### 4. How to perform the test you selected?

Complete the code below to test if Diet A is effective in reducing the weights of the participants:

<codeblock id="chap1_diet_3">

Remember to we are interested in testing if the participants are losing weight, so we should use `alternative = "greater"` 

</codeblock>

### 5. What can we conclude?

Based on the test you performed and considering a type I error (i.e. "alpha") of 5%, what can you conclude:

<choice id="chap1_diet_2">
<opt text="The test shows that it is sure that Diet A significantly reduces the weight of the participants." > Sadly, we can never be sure with statistical methods... </opt>
<opt text="We don't really know..."> In some sense, this is correct... üòâ  However, the statistical method you selected indicates that it is very likely that the Diet is working. </opt>
<opt text="We can reject the null hypothesis at the significance level of 5% and conclude that Diet A significantly reduces the weight of the participants." correct = "true"> Yay! üëç </opt>
<opt text="We cannot reject the null hypothesis at the significance level of 5%."> Actually, in this case the p-value is smaller that 5% as it is 0.00101%, so we can reject the null.</opt>
</choice>

<exercise id="6" title="Analysis of hospital length of stay of COVID 19 patients">

</exercise>

<exercise id="7" title="Homework 1">

We consider data from Parisi, et al., 2021 which studies the applicability of predictive models for intensive care admission of COVID-19 patients in a secondary care hospital in Belgium. Indeed, this study is based on data of patients admitted to an emergency department with a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test. For the moment, the only variable we will consider is the oxygen saturation of the patients and your goal is to conduct an analysis based on this data to answer the following questions:

1. Can we conclude that the admitted COVID 19 patients have an average oxygen saturation that can be considered low?
2. Can we conclude that the admitted COVID 19 patients have an average oxygen saturation below 93%?
3. Can we conclude that the COVID 19 patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) tend to have a lower oxygen saturation than the ones that are not? For example, is it reasonable to conclude that average oxygen saturation of ICU patients is lower than 92%? Similarly, is it reasonable to conclude that average oxygen saturation of non ICU patients is greater than 92%?

The data can be obtained as follows:

```r
library(idar)
data(covid)

# SpO2
spo2 = covid$spo2

# SpO2 (in ICU)
icu = covid$icu
spo2_icu = spo2[icu == 1]

# SpO2 (not in ICU)
spo2_not_icu = spo2[icu == 0]
```

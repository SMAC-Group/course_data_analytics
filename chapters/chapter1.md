<exercise id="1" title="Installing R and RStudio">

## Installing `R`

This course will make use of the `R` programming language. The `R` language is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the [`R` Foundation for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). `R` is widely used by data scientists, data miners and statisticians for data analysis and developing statistical software.

### Installing `R` on macOS

To install `R` on macOS, download the `.pkg` installer on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `R` on Windows

To install `R` on Windows, download the `.exe` installer on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `R` in Ubuntu Linux

To install `R` on Ubuntu Linux, follow the procedure detailed [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).


## Installing `RStudio`

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. We will be using RStudio Desktop throughout the semester. Please install it from the [RStudio‚Äôs official webpage](https://www.rstudio.com/).


### Installing `RStudio` on macOS

To install `RStudio` on macOS, download the macOS `.dmg` installer on the [RStudio‚Äôs products page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `RStudio` on Windows

To install `RStudio` on Windows, download the Windows `.exe` installer the [RStudio‚Äôs products page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `RStudio` in Ubuntu Linux

To install `RStudio` on Ubuntu Linux, download the Ubuntu/Debian `.deb` installer the [RStudio‚Äôs products page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You can then install the `.deb` file.

### Installing `R` package `idar` 

We have developed an `R` package for this class which is called `idar` (Introduction to Data Analytics with `R` - `idar`) and that you can install by running the following code in your R console:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/SMAC-Group/idar")
```

To test if the package is correctly installed you can simply run

```r
library(idar)
```

If you see no error then the package is correctly installed! Below is a gif illustrating the installation of the `idar` `R` package:

<exercise id="4" title="Analysis of the Diet dataset">


<slides source="chapter1_diet">
</slides>
</exercise>

<exercise id="5" title="Exercise on the Diet dataset">

Previously, we saw that diet B is effective in reducing the weights of the participants. Is it also the case for diet A?

### 1. How to get the data?

Complete the code below to get the data for diet A:

<codeblock id="chap1_diet_1">

The variable `posw` allows to select the diet we are interested in.

</codeblock>

### 2. How to plot the data?

Complete the code below to plot the data for diet A:

<codeblock id="chap1_diet_2">

You can use the functions `boxplot_w_points` and `hist_compare_to_normal`.

</codeblock>

### 3. Which test should we use?

Based on the graph you produce, which test appears the most appropriate to test if diet A leads to a significant weight loss:

<choice id="chap1_diet_1">
<opt text="t-test."> The t-test doesn't appear to be an ideal choice in this case given the outliers that can be observed in the graph...</opt>
<opt text="Wilcoxon test." correct = "true" > Given the outliers that can be observed this test appears to be a suitable choice. </opt>
<opt text="other tests should be used here."> While it is true that other methods could be used here, one of the two tests above seems reasonable here. </opt>
</choice>

### 4. How to perform the test you selected?

Complete the code below to test if diet A is effective in reducing the weights of the participants:

<codeblock id="chap1_diet_3">

Remember that we are interested in testing if the participants are losing weights, so we should use `alternative = "greater"`. 

</codeblock>

### 5. What can we conclude?

Based on the test you performed and considering a type I error (i.e. "alpha") of 5%, we can conclude that:

<choice id="chap1_diet_2">
<opt text="We can be sure that diet A significantly reduces the weights of the participants." > Sadly, we can never be sure with statistical methods... </opt>
<opt text="We don't really know..."> In some sense, this is correct... üòâ  However, the statistical method you selected indicates that it is very likely that the diet is working. </opt>
<opt text="We can reject the null hypothesis at the significance level of 5% and conclude that diet A significantly reduces the weights of the participants." correct = "true"> Yay! üëç </opt>
<opt text="We cannot reject the null hypothesis at the significance level of 5%."> Actually, in this case the p-value is smaller than 5% as it is 0.00101%, so we can reject the null hypothesis.</opt>
</choice>

</exercise>


<exercise id="6" title="Exercise on the dexamethasone dataset">

We consider data from Abouir, et al., (2022) which is an observational study conducted at Geneva University Hospitals to assess the impact of weight 
on the pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone in normal-weight versus
obese patients hospitalized for COVID-19. For the moment, we will only 
consider the variable `lenght_hospital`, which corresponds to the
length of stay in days of the patients. Our goal is to conduct
an analysis to assess if it can be concluded that the average length of stay is longer than 10 days. To analyze the data, we start loading the data as follows: 

```r
library(idar)
data(codex)
```

and have a look at the data:

```r
boxplot_w_points(codex$lenght_hospital, horizontal = T, 
    xlab = "Length of stay (day)")
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="chap1_length_of_stay_1.png" alt=" " width="70%"></div>

```r
hist_compare_to_normal(codex$lenght_hospital)(), horizontal = T, 
    xlab = "Length of stay (day)")
```

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="chap1_length_of_stay_2.png" alt=" " width="70%"></div>

Based on these graphs which test appears the most appropriate:

<choice id="chap1_codex_2">
<opt text="t-test."> The t-test doesn't appear to be an ideal choice in this case given the outliers that can be observed in the graph...</opt>
<opt text="Wilcoxon test." correct = "true" > Given the outliers that can be observed this test appears to be a suitable choice. </opt>
<opt text="other tests should be used here."> While it is true that other methods could be used here, one of the two tests above seems reasonable here. </opt>
</choice>

Using the test you selected, what is the p-value corresponding to the test of interest:

<choice id="chap1_codex_3">
<opt text="8.706e-07"> You may have used the wrong value for `mu`. </opt>
<opt text="1.741e-06"> You may have used the wrong value for `mu` and the wrong alternative hypothesis. </opt>
<opt text="0.08602" correct = "true"> Yay! üòâ </opt>
<opt text="0.172"> You may have used  the wrong alternative hypothesis. </opt>
<opt text="0.9177"> You may have used  the wrong alternative hypothesis. </opt>
<opt text="Something else..."> You may have used the wrong value for `mu` and/or the wrong alternative hypothesis. </opt>
</choice>

Based on this p-value what can you conclude:

<choice id="chap1_codex_4">
<opt text="We can accept the null at 5% significance level and conclude that the average length of stay is equal to 10 days."> Actually, you can never accept the null üòí.</opt>
<opt text="We fail to reject the null at 5% significance level." correct = "true" > </opt>
<opt text="We can reject the null at 5% significance level and conclude that the average length of stay is equal to 10 days."> </opt>
</choice>

</exercise>

<exercise id="7" title="Homework 1">

We consider data from Parisi, et al., (2021) which studies the applicability of predictive models for intensive care admission of COVID-19 patients in a secondary care hospital in Belgium. Indeed, this study is based on data of patients admitted to an emergency department with a positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test. For the moment, the only variable we will consider is the oxygen saturation of the patients and your goal is to conduct an analysis based on this data to answer the following questions:

1. Can we conclude that the admitted COVID-19 patients have an average oxygen saturation that can be considered low?
2. Can we conclude that the admitted COVID-19 patients have an average oxygen saturation below 93%?
3. Can we conclude that the COVID-19 patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) tend to have a lower oxygen saturation than the ones that are not? For example, is it reasonable to conclude that average oxygen saturation of ICU patients is lower than 92%? Similarly, is it reasonable to conclude that average oxygen saturation of non ICU patients is greater than 92%?

The data can be obtained as follows:

```r
library(idar)
data(covid)

# SpO2
spo2 = covid$spo2

# SpO2 (in ICU)
icu = covid$icu
spo2_icu = spo2[icu == 1]

# SpO2 (not in ICU)
spo2_not_icu = spo2[icu == 0]
```

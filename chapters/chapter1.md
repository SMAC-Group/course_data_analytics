<exercise id="1" title="Installing R and RStudio">

## Installing `R`

This course will make use of the `R` programming language. The `R` language is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the [`R` Foundation for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). `R` is widely used by data scientists, data miners and statisticians for data analysis and developing statistical software.

### Installing `R` on macOS

To install `R` on macOS, download the `.pkg` installer on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `R` on Windows

To install `R` on Windows, download the `.exe` installer on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `R` in Ubuntu Linux

To install `R` on Ubuntu Linux, follow the procedure detailled [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).


## Installing `RStudio`

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. An Integrated Development Environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. We will be using RStudio Desktop throughout the semester. Please install it by going at [RStudio‚Äôs official webpage](https://www.rstudio.com/).


### Installing `RStudio` on macOS

To install `RStudio` on macOS, download the macOS `.dmg` installer on the [RStudio‚Äôs products page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `RStudio` on Windows

To install `RStudio` on Windows, download the Windows `.exe` installer the [RStudio‚Äôs products page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and execute it once downloaded.

### Installing `RStudio` in Ubuntu Linux

To install `RStudio` on Ubuntu Linux, download the Ubuntu/Debian `.deb` installer the [RStudio‚Äôs products page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You can then install the `.deb` file.

### Installing `R` package `idar` 

We have developed an `R` package for this class which is called `idar` (Introduction to Data Analytics with `R` - `idar`) and that you can install by running the following code in your R console:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/SMAC-Group/idar", force = TRUE)
```

To test if the package was correctly installed you cans simply run

```r
library(idar)
```

If you see no error then the package was correctly installed! Below is a gif illustrating the install of the `idar` `R` package:

</exercise>

<exercise id="4" title="Exercises on the Diet dataset">

Previously, we saw that Diet B was effective in reducing the weights of the participants. Is it also the case for Diet A?

### 1. How to get the data?

Complete the code below to get the data for Diet A:

<codeblock id="chap1_diet_1">

The variable `posw` allows to select the diet we are interested in.

</codeblock>

### 2. How to plot the data?

Complete the code below to plot the data for Diet A:

<codeblock id="chap1_diet_2">

You can use the function `boxplot_w_points`.

</codeblock>

### 3. Which test should we use?

Based on the graph you produced which test appears the most appropriate to test if Diet A leads to a significant weight loss:

<choice id="chap1_diet_1">
<opt text="t-test."> The t-test doesn't appear to be an ideal choice in this case given the outliers that can be observed in the graph...</opt>
<opt text="Wilcoxon test." correct = "true" > Given the outliers that can be observed this test appears to be a suitable choice. </opt>
<opt text="other tests should be used here."> While it is true that other methods could be used here, one of the two tests above seems reasonable here. </opt>
</choice>

### 4. How to perform the test you selected?

Complete the code below to test if Diet A is effective in reducing the weights of the participants:

<codeblock id="chap1_diet_3">

Remember to we are interested in testing if the participants are losing weight, so we should use `alternative = "greater"` 

</codeblock>

### 5. What can we conclude?

Based on the test you performed and considering a type I error (i.e. "alpha") of 5%, what can you conclude:

<choice id="chap1_diet_2">
<opt text="The test shows that it is sure that Diet A significantly reduces the weight of the participants." > Sadly, we can never be sure with statistical methods... </opt>
<opt text="We don't really know..."> In some sense, this is correct... üòâ  However, the statistical method you selected indicates that it is very likely that the Diet is working. </opt>
<opt text="We can reject the null hypothesis at the significance level of 5% and conclude that Diet A significantly reduces the weight of the participants." correct = "true"> Yay! üëç </opt>
<opt text="We cannot reject the null hypothesis at the significance level of 5%."> Actually, in this case the p-value is smaller that 5% as it is 0.00101%, so we can reject the null.</opt>
</choice>

## Objectif
This course is intended to provide an introduction to statistical programming using the R language. It will also provide students with notions of data management, manipulation and analysis as well as of reproducible research, result-sharing and version control (using GitHub). At the end of the class, students should be able to automatically extract data from websites and create interactive web apps as well as dynamic reports to visualize and analyze them.

## Descriptif
Tentative list of topics that will be discussed in this class are listed below:

- Reproducible research: knitr and rmarkdown;
- Version control: Github;
- Introduction to programming: Data structures, logical operators, control structures and functions;
- Visualizations: Exploratory data analysis with Base R and ggplot2;
- R packages: Construction of R-packages using devtools, roxygen2, pkgdown;
- Web scrapping: Automatic extraction of data from websites using rvest and quantmod;
- Web applications: interactive web apps using Shiny.
- High Performance Computing: Rcpp.

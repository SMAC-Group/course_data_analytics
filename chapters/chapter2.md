<exercise id="1" title="General information">

In this chapter we will discuss different elements regarding Control Structure with `R`.
You can find further informations regarding:
- Logical operators [here](https://smac-group.github.io/ds/section-control.html#section-logoperators)
- Selection operators [here](https://smac-group.github.io/ds/section-control.html#section-selection-operators)
- Iterative Control Statements [here](https://smac-group.github.io/ds/section-control.html#section-iter_cont_stat)

### 1) Write a code that produce the latin alphabet sequence of letters, such that the code print a capital letter if the letter has a odd number on the sequence and a lowercase letter otherwise.

<codeblock id="02_02">
You could solve this problem using the vectors `letters` and `LETTERS` as well as the `%%` operator.
</codeblock>

### 2) Guess the value of the following commands:

```r
a = c(1,4,8,6,3,7)
b = c(6,8,9,6,10,11)
a != b
```

<choice id="1">
<opt text="<code>[1] FALSE</code>" >
</opt>
<opt text="<code>[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE </code>"  >
</opt>
<opt text="<code>[1] TRUE</code>" >
</opt>
<opt text="<code>[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE</code>" correct="true">
</opt>
</choice>

### 3) In this exercise, you will implement a simple sorting algorithm called the "Bubble Sort". Read about the algorithmic structure of this algorithm [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) and complete the following code.

### 4) In this exercise, you will implement an algorithm that can solve a simple maze such as the one below.

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="little_maze.jpg" alt=" " width="35%">
</div>

Under some conditions regarding the maze, a simple strategy could be:

- if there is space in front of you, go forward
- else, if there is space on your right, turn right
- else, if there is space on your left, turn left
- else, [all three sides (forward, left, right) are closed] turn around

Complete the code below in order to solve the following maze:

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="mymaze.png" alt=" " width="35%">
</div>

The code, once completed, should return you the following output.

Multiple Choice: Which smooth term in this model is _significant_ and _linear_?
<choice id="1">
<opt text = "<code>this is written in code font</code>" >
`s(weight)` has `edf` over five, indicating it is nonlinear."
</opt>
<opt text="length" >
`s(length)` has a `p-value` over 0.05 and no stars, indicating it is not significant.
</opt>
<opt text="price" correct="true">
Correct! `price` is significant (p <0.05) and linear (`edf` near 1).
</opt>
<opt text="rpm">
`s(rpm)` has `edf` over five, indicating it is nonlinear.
</opt>
<opt text="width">
`s(width)` has a `p-value` over 0.05 and no stars, indicating it is not significant.

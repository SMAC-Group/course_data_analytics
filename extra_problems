### 1) Consider the dataset `palmerpenguins` in the packages `palmerpenguins`.Represent the bill length for species Gentoo and Chinstrap. We would like to test that the true difference in means for variable `bill_length_mm`
between group Chinstrap and group Gentoo is greater than 0

Check the argument `alternative` in the documentation of function `t.test` (You can find the documentation with `?t.test` )

### 4) Which statements following is true?
<choice id="2">
<opt text="A test is of significant level alpha when the probability of making a type I error equals 1-alpha." >
</opt>
<opt text="A test is of power beta when the probability to make a type II error is 1-beta." correct="true">
</opt>
<opt text="A test is of significant level alpha when the probability of making a type II error equals 1-alpha.">
</opt>
<opt text="A test is of power beta when the probability to make a type II error is beta.">
</opt>
</choice>

### 1) We saw previously, that diet B (in the dataset `diet` of the `idar` package) was effective in reducing the weights of the participents. Is it also the case when only the women in the study are considered? Complete the code below and comment on the results.

### 1) Consider the boxplots of data associated with two groups: "treatment" and "control". Consider that you want to test the difference in the central value of both distributions. What test should you consider and why?

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="plot1.png" alt=" " width="55%">
</div>

<choice id="6">
<opt text="One should consider a t-test because we want to test the difference in their central value." >
</opt>
<opt text="We should consider a t-test because there are some extreme observations in the control group" >
</opt>
<opt text="We should consider a Wilcoxon rank test because the extreme observations in the control group suggest that the data are not normally distributed and we would prefer to rely on a non-parametric test" correct="true">
</opt>
<opt text="We don't need to test anything because it is clear on the graph that the median of the control group is above the median of the treatment group.">
</opt>
</choice>
